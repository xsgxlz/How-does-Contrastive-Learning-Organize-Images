# Contrastive Learning and Supervised Learning: A Comparative Study on Data Organization

Welcome to the repository for our recent study on the differences in data organization between contrastive and supervised learning methods. Our research sheds light on the unique characteristics of clusters formed by these two types of learning methods, specifically focusing on the concept of locally dense clusters.

## About the Study
In our work, we introduce a novel metric known as Relative Local Density (RLD) to quantitatively measure local density within clusters. We provide illustrative examples to differentiate between locally dense clusters and globally dense ones. 

Our comparative analysis between contrastive and supervised learning reveals that while the former fosters locally dense clusters, the latter tends to create clusters with both local and global density. We further explore the utilization of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) classifier as an alternative to linear classifiers for better handling locally dense clusters. 

Our findings are further validated using t-SNE visualizations, which provide a visual representation of the distinctions between the features generated by the two learning methods. 

## Repository Contents
This repository will soon host the codebase used for our study. We are currently in the process of cleaning and organizing the code to ensure that it is user-friendly and easily understandable.

## Code Availability
We appreciate your interest in our research, and we understand the importance of making our code accessible for further exploration and potential improvements. 

We're currently working on cleaning up the code and making it more understandable for public use. Once this process is complete, we'll upload the full codebase to this repository. We aim to make our code available as soon as possible. We recommend watching this repository to get notified once the codebase is available.

## Contributing
Once the codebase is made available, we welcome contributions that could help improve our work. Please feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues if you have suggestions for improvements or if you encounter any problems.
